There are three places that I store my janus customizations:

1. .janus/          - janus pathogen 'bundle' directory AND snipmate directory.  That's it!
2. .janus.local/    - janus customizations: .vimrc.before (custom keymappings)
3. .janus.var/      - variable stuff, such as sessions, caches, vimdirs, etc
